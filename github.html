			<h2>Dear GitHub,</h2>

			<p>I am sorry. I have been using you wrong for a very long time. But I appreciate you being patient with me as I have learned how to properly use you. Because of you, I am able to store my git repositories online and share my code with others. All I have to do is go to github.com and create a free account and then create a new repository. I can use the terminal to cd into my local git repository project by using <em>git remote add origin github-repo-url</em> and <em>git push -u origin master</em>. Once I am really ready to commit to this, I can simply <em>git push</em>. I can also make a <em>README</em> to add more information about the committed files. I feel so safe with you, as I know my files will never get lost once they are pushed to GitHub. Thank you for the security.</p>

			<p>Love, Kaelen</p>
