			<h2 >Dear Bash,</h2>

			<p>I’ll admit that when we first got together, it was hard. I had to remember several new commands to make this work. I had to spend a lot of time installing you on my computer in order for you to work. Sometimes you are different to Mac than you are to me, Windows, making it more difficult for me. But even though the open command doesn’t work on me, I have found a way to make it work by using cmd.exe /C start 'file'. Despite the challenges, now I realize just how lucky I am to be with someone who is so beautiful. You take me deeper than just a GUI (Graphical User Interface) into beautiful customizable colors. You are so organized - I can use the cd command to go to whichever directory I need and the ls command to see what is inside that directory. With your simple pwd, I never get lost with you. You not only make things like connecting to the server easy, but you are also fun! I can use you to make a banner and I can watch Star Wars on you! This relationship seemed scary at first, but now I am realizing just how worth it it is! </p>

			<p>Love, Kaelen</p>
