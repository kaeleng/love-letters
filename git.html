			<h2>Dear Git,</h2>

			<p>At first, I always confused you with GitHub, but now I see you for your unique qualities. You are so good at keeping track of all of the changes I have made to my files over time, making my life so much easier. All it takes for me to create a repository with you is a simple <em>git init</em>. With <em>git status</em>, you keep track of files that I have changed and I can add them to the repository with <em>git add .</em>. As long as I don’t forget to write you sweet message, committing to you is so easy and rewarding with a <em>git -m “message”</em>. You are forgiving when I make mistakes, letting me just <em>git checkout “filename”</em> for us to return to the original state we were at. It is so much fun to look back at our memories using git log and seeing how far we have come. You are also so good at helping me when I am confused, as I can say <em>git help</em> and you will show me all of the common commands. It has taken me a while to see your use, but now that I understand you, I will never leave you.</p>

			<p>Love, Kaelen</p>
